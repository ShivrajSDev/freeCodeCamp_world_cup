# freeCodeCamp - World Cup Database Project

This is one of the projects that requires completion as part of [freeCodeCamp's Relational Database Certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/relational-database/).

As part of the [project's requirements](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/relational-database/build-a-world-cup-database-project/build-a-world-cup-database), this repository includes the following files (alongside the games.csv file that was already provided beforehand for the project):

- An insert_data.sh bash file for inserting data from the games.csv file into a database.
- A queries.sh bash file to output data from querying the database.
- A worldcup.sql file that creates a PostgreSQL database with the data needed for passing the test.
